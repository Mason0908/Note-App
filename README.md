<h1>WeNote</h1>

Welcome to our amazing Android note-taking application, with an amazing set of features designed specifically for university students!

Just like in Jeff's template, this README is mostly merely a pointer to [the wiki](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/y424lu/cs398_project/-/wikis/home), which actually contains all the information needed for the final report!

<h3>Wiki</h3>

The wiki contains a landing page for the project plus detailed pages for different course deliverables.

All the information required (description, instructions, user guide, requirements, design, implementation, testing, ackowledgments, license, release notes, etc.) are stored [over there](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/y424lu/cs398_project/-/wikis/home)!

<h3>Issues and Milestones</h3>

We use [Issues](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/y424lu/cs398_project/-/issues) to track the work to be done (where an issue represents an assignable task, which may be a new feature, change to an existing feature, or a bug fix). Milestones are a way of grouping issues into Sprints. We have milestones for Sprint 1 through Sprint 3.
